# LearnMap.app — Roadmap

> Scope updated 2026-07-06: hosted, multi-user, auth + profiles, PostgreSQL. See `docs/DECISIONS.md` ADR-007+.

## Completed Milestones

**Milestone 0 — Planning & Setup**
- Design document analyzed, ambiguities resolved, subagent roster defined, scope revision (hosted/multi-user/auth/Postgres) incorporated, plan approved 2026-07-06.

**Milestone 1 — Backend Foundation + Auth** (completed 2026-07-06)
- Go module + folder scaffolding per ARCHITECTURE.md, plus `internal/apperror` (typed service errors) and `internal/testutil` (test DB helper) added during implementation
- PostgreSQL via versioned golang-migrate SQL migrations (not GORM AutoMigrate, per ADR-009)
- GORM models: `users`, `refresh_tokens`, `learning_items`, `study_sessions`, `events` — UUID PKs, soft deletes, `user_id` on every user-owned table
- Auth service (bcrypt + JWT access token + rotating httpOnly refresh cookie), invite-code-gated registration, profile update/change-password
- Learning item hierarchy CRUD + status transitions + cascade soft-delete; study session CRUD; live dashboard/stats aggregation
- Full middleware stack: JWT auth, CORS (explicit origins), rate limiting on auth endpoints, panic recovery, standard error envelope
- Automated tests (service + full-stack `httptest`) including the mandatory two-user cross-user isolation test; manual end-to-end verification against real Postgres
- Exit criteria met: `go build`/`go vet`/`gofmt` clean, all tests green (`go test ./... -p 1`), code-reviewed (two fixes applied: event-write failures now logged instead of silently swallowed; error matching switched to `errors.As` for robustness)

**Milestone 2 — Frontend Foundation, Navigation & Auth UI (mobile-first)** (completed 2026-07-06)
- Vite + React 19 + TS scaffold; TailwindCSS v4 tokens mapped onto shadcn/ui (light theme only); shadcn/ui init with button/input/label/card/dialog/dropdown-menu/skeleton/sonner/separator/badge
- Register / Login pages (RHF + Zod, mirrors backend validation); Axios client with bearer-token attach + silent-refresh-on-401 (deduplicated across concurrent requests)
- ProtectedRoute wrapper; redirect unauthenticated users to `/login` and back
- App shell responsive: left sidebar (tablet/desktop) collapses to a bottom tab bar (phone); search bar, breadcrumb, floating add button on every page
- Learning Tree page: fetch `/items`, assemble tree client-side, expand/collapse persisted to localStorage, indentation adapts on phone widths, completed items green+checkmark, real empty state
- Exit criteria: typecheck/build/lint clean. Backend request logs confirm a real register→me→dashboard flow succeeded end to end; responsive breakpoint behavior verified via code review and dev-server checks but not independently re-confirmed with browser automation in this pass (tooling wasn't set up) — flagged for a spot-check before Milestone 5's dedicated cross-device QA.

**Milestone 3 — Study Sessions, Task Management & Profile** (completed 2026-07-06)
- Item CRUD: add sub-item, rename, mark complete/reopen, delete-with-confirmation — all via a per-node actions menu plus a status-toggle circle, wired through `ItemFormDialog` (shared create/rename) and `DeleteItemDialog`
- Study Sessions page: table, "Add Session" dialog (topic/hours/date/notes), delete with confirmation
- Profile page: display name/avatar URL edit (synced live into the nav via `updateUser`), change password
- Dashboard wired to live `/dashboard` data: stat cards, top topics, today's sessions, recent activity
- Exit criteria: build/typecheck/lint clean; API contract cross-checked field-by-field against the backend DTOs. Full click-through (create→track→complete→log-session, two-account isolation) not independently re-verified via browser automation in this pass — same tooling gap as Milestone 2, flagged for a spot-check before Milestone 5.

## Current Milestone

**Milestone 4 — Charts & Statistics** (not started)
- `/stats` endpoint (weekly/monthly/yearly aggregation), scoped per user
- Recharts: weekly hours, monthly hours, top topics, completion %
- Exit criteria: charts render live per-user data, animate on load, responsive at all breakpoints

### Milestone 5 — Polish & Cross-Device QA
- Empty/loading/error states, micro-interactions (150–200ms)
- Real-device testing (actual phone browser + laptop browser, not just devtools emulation)
- Accessibility pass on tap targets/contrast, including auth/profile screens
- Final QA against DD_v1 §17 Success Criteria

### Milestone 6 — Deployment & Pilot Rollout
- Dockerfiles (backend multi-stage build) + `docker-compose.yml` for local dev parity (Postgres + backend + frontend)
- Provision managed Postgres; deploy backend container and frontend static build
- Custom domain / HTTPS, CORS allow-list for the real deployed origin(s), production secrets (`JWT_SECRET`, `DATABASE_URL`, invite code)
- Smoke test from a real phone browser and laptop browser over the internet
- Basic structured logging; distribute invite code + pilot accounts to testers

## Deferred Ideas (explicitly out of MVP scope)

### Phase 2 — AI features (not finalized, architecture readiness only — see ARCHITECTURE.md §10)
- Learning Generator
- Task Breakdown
- Explain Anything
- Quiz Generator
- others TBD

The `events` table, per-user scoping, and the AI seam/job-queue/usage-tracking groundwork (ADR-017–020) all exist specifically so these can be built later without an architectural rewrite. None are scheduled or scoped yet.

### Other deferred ideas
- Note editor, native mobile app
- Collaboration/shared workspaces between users (each pilot tester's data stays private to them)
- OAuth/social login, email verification, "forgot password" email flow (defer past pilot — manual reset by admin if needed during pilot)
- Drag-and-drop manual reordering (schema has a `position` column reserved for this)
- Avatar file upload (MVP profile uses a URL field, not blob storage)
